WORKING OF A MAIL SERVER:
o	When we send an email, our computer connects to our email serviceâ€™s mail server. A server is a centralized computer which manages a specific type of service.

One SMTP server can pass on the mail to another SMTP server and relay it to the destination through several hops.
